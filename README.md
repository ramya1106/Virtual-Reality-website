## 📍 Overview

<code>Nowadays Many of the companies checks persons health risks based on one parameter but here we will take various paramenter like Bp,Height,Weight etc and then we will Use Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict the persons health as No risk , Low risk and High risk and based on the type of risk we will provide recommendations like Health tips,Specialist recommendations etc and at last we will provide a report in the form of pdf which is downloadable.</code>
